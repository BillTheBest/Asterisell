= Rationale =

Testing all the application using only regression testing is not possible due to constraints on development time.

So some tests are executed using regression tests and other manually before releasing a new version.

= Initial Pass =

Load demo data using:

  cd scripts
  sh make_regression_testing

= Application Test =

Load demo data and perform various tests on application behaviour:
  * various filters on CALL REPORT;
  * export CALLS to CSV;
  * insert conflicting rates and test if there are errors;
  * invoices and proper round of amounts;
